To find out how to apply a metered license, follow the appropriate link below. For more information about metered licenses review [the FAQ](/faqs/licensing/metered).

**Note:** Your metered license key pair will work with all .NET and Java products.  If you have a Aspose.Total license key you must remember to apply the license individually for each product you are using.
