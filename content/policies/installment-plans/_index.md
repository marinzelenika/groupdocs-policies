##### **Installment Plans**
In addition to offering payment by Credit Card or Wire Transfer, if you're placing an order and your order total is greater than $5000 USD, GroupDocs offers the option to split the cost of your GroupDocs license over several installments.

You will be issued with [temporary licenses](/temporary-license/) to cover the period your installment plan spans. After receipt of an installment payment, an GroupDocs product temporary license will automatically be sent to your registered email address. Upon your final installment payment you will be sent a full GroupDocs product license.

Please use our [Purchase wizard](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) to apply for an Installment Plan. If your order is eligible, the section "Choose an installment plan" is displayed on the Checkout page. Three types of installment plans are available.

&nbsp;  
##### **Half Now, Half Later Installment Plan**
This plan splits your GroupDocs license cost into two equal amounts.

Payment of the first installment of 50% of the license cost is required immediately. The second installment for the remainder of the balance is required six months after the first payment.
