### Android API Licensing
The licensing for Android products are primarily based on apps and not physical locations or servers.

GroupDocs licenses for Android are based on the number of developers and the number of apps that GroupDocs products are used for and how many locations (offices, app stores) that the app is deployed to.

* We have two sizes of developer licenses: single or up to ten developers.
* We offer three sizes of app licenses: single, up to 10 apps and unlimited.
* Apps can be deployed to one (Enterprise), or unlimited locations.   

&nbsp;  
Developer, app and locations combine to give four license types:
