##### **GroupDocs Reseller Policy**

###### **Discount**

GroupDocs grants approved resellers a 10% discount on sales of select products. GroupDocs will not approve a higher discount for any reseller for any reason.

###### **Price Changes**

Prices are subject to change upon notice by GroupDocs to Resellers. GroupDocs will announce price changes before they are made through the Reseller Newsletter. Resellers are obligated to ensure they can receive email communications from GroupDocs.

###### **Customer Autonomy**

Resellers agree that customers are free to choose between purchasing from a reseller or directly from GroupDocs for new orders or renewals of existing orders. If a reseller opts to no longer offer GroupDocs's products, for any reason, they must refer customers to GroupDocs and fully cooperate with GroupDocs in connection therewith.

###### **No Redistribution**

Resellers may not act as a distributor. Resellers may not resell GroupDocs's products to other resellers for further resale or redistribution.
