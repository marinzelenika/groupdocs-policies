We are often asked if we support every single feature of the original application that our APIs allow you to program for. Does, for example, GroupDocs.Words for .NET support all of the features of Microsoft Word, from text layout to image management? Does GroupDocs.Cells for Java support all the features of Microsoft Excel, from formulas through graphs to pivot tables?

As our customers appreciate, dealing with file-formats is difficult. This is why GroupDocs exists: we want to make it easy for you to deal with complex file formats and operations from within your own applications. That way you don't have to spend many years of development time building the tools that we've put so much effort into.

We've built an impressive reputation over the course of our 10 year history and [our customers](https://about.groupdocs.com/customers/) agree. [GroupDocs is the first choice of many customers](https://about.groupdocs.com/customers/success-stories/) and we are proud that we can solve the vast majority of our customers file format needs.

We listen to every piece of customer feedback, every new feature request, enhancement or issue raised is noted and placed in our issue tracking database. Our roadmap is managed on a fair "first come first served" basis. We work through your requests to continually improve the products and cater to every customer's demands.

To ensure new customers get the opportunity to test and evaluate our products fully we offer 100% free evaluation downloads. Evaluation downloads are fully functional time limited licenses with extensive documentation and demo code as well as free technical support. We want to make sure that our customers can try out every feature of our products before buying. To make sure that a feature is supported, check the documentation, run a trial or ask in our [Support forums](https://forum.groupdocs.com/).

With each release we come closer to our eventual goal of 100% compatibility with all of our supported file formats. We're the market leaders in this area but we still have work to do. We love the challenge of satisfying every customer demand and will continue to tirelessly extend our products for our customers.
